# **Typescript Todo App**

## **Description**

This is a simple Todo app built with TypeScript and React that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. The app uses React's Context API and custom hooks to manage state and provide a responsive user interface.

## **Getting Started**

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnkurChunekar/react-vite-typescript.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-vite-typescript
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the app at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)** in your browser.

## **Usage**

To add a new task, enter the task description in the input field at the top of the page and press "Enter" or click the "Add Reminder" button.

To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.
